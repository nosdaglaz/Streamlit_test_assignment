This is my first tiny Streamlit app, created during a test assignment for an internship. I enjoyed making it :)<p>
You can try it out here: https://apptestassignment-xa3haukfnu2rcymuhhchda.streamlit.app/<p>
The app allows users to retrieve the 20 most recent announcements from the Australian Securities Exchange for a short list of tickers, filter them by ticker, and display only tickers that have a "Trading Halt" announcement in their recent announcements.
